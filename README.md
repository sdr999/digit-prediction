# digit-prediction
Predicting digits by creating a model using the MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) Dataset.
Developing an artificial neural network classifier for recognizing handwritten digits which was trained and tested using MNIST dataset giving 96% accuracy.
-The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits. 
-Each image is 28x28 pixels, with each pixel representing a grayscale intensity value. The dataset also includes labels for each image, specifying which digit it represents. 
-The goal of using the MNIST dataset is to develop a model that can accurately recognize digits from the images.
-The model can then be used to make predictions about other images of handwritten digits. By training the model on the MNIST dataset, it can learn to recognize patterns in the images and make accurate predictions.
